An implementation of a fuzzy algorithm for process scheduling. Processes will be sorted by arrival time first and then priority. Calculating process priority will be based on previous process priority and current execution time. Process priorty can fall in the range of very low, low, medium, high, and very high. My implementation of this algorithm is based off a paper by Rajani Kumari, Vivek Kumar Sharma, and Sandeep Kumar. I will link the paper.
